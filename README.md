# Solana Auction Game Smart Contract

## Overview
This project contains a Solana smart contract for an auction game, where users can place bids on items in an auction. The contract handles bid placement, auction status, and winner selection once the auction ends.

## Features
- **Bid Placement:** Users can place bids during an active auction.
- **Auction Timer:** The auction will end after a set duration.
- **Winner Selection:** The highest bid at the end of the auction wins.
- **Auction Status:** Users can view the current auction status (active, ended).

## Requirements
- **Solana CLI** (for interacting with Solana network)
- **Rust** (for building and deploying the smart contract)
- **Anchor** (for Solana smart contract development)
